<header>NFSv4 Pseudofilesystem to export</header>

NFSv4 client sees the NFSv4 server's exports as existing inside a single filesystem, called the NFSv4 pseudofilesystem. Here you must define the directory for the pseudofilesystem root. 
You will still be able to add directories that are not bellow the root to the pseudofilesystem(with mount --bind).<br>
