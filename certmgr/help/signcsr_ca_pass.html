<header>CA Pass Phrase </header>

<P>The CA root certificate is usually protected by a pass phrase that must
be input in this field in order that it may be used to sign the new
certificate.  If the root certificate is protected by a pass phrase and
no phrase is entered then the openssl binary may hang and the system 
response times  may be seriously impacted.</P>
